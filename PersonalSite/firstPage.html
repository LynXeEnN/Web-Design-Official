            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h4> UX/UI Designer</h4>
            <p> I am a designer with a strong passion for design strategy, illustration and typography.
            Leveraging a successful career in architecture, I strive to meet user needs and behaviours while balancing
            them with client business needs. My strengths are my creativity, bringing ideas to the table, putting myself
            in the user's shoes and solving issues that at first seem impossible. Looking for next role within
            a web/app or product design space to ultilise my UX/UI skills and enhance user experiences within mobile,
            tablet or web-based devices.</p>

            <h5> UX Design</h5>
            <i class="fa-solid fa-broom-ball"></i>
            <p>UX (user experience) designers measure and optimise applications (usually web based) to
                improve ease of use (usability), and create the best user experience by exploring many different
                approaches to solve end-usersâ€™ problems. One way that a UX designer might do this is by conducting
                in-person user tests to observe behaviour. They then refine and tweak apps, software and websites to
                create products that people like and find easy to use.</p>

            <h5> UI Design</h5>
            <p>A User Interface (UI) Designer is a professional who works closely with a User Experience (UX) designer
                to create and implement a user interface that is intuitive but also has the right look and feel required
                in the product design.</p>

            <h5> Web Design</h5>
            <p>A web designer is responsible for creating the design and layout of a website or web pages.
                It and can mean working on a brand new website or updating an already existing site. Their role is
                different to web developers, who specialise in making web designs a reality or writing code that
                dictates how different parts of the website fit together. However, there can be crossover between
                the two roles.</p>
